# Coins_Identification

This project aims to automatically identify and classify coins of different denominations using image processing techniques. The system takes an image of coins as input and applies segmentation, morphological operations, and feature extraction to detect and recognize the coin values.
It is useful for applications like automated coin sorters, vending machines, or financial digitization where physical currency needs to be recognized efficiently.

## Tech Stack
Python – Core programming language
OpenCV – For image processing and computer vision tasks
NumPy – Numerical computations and matrix operations
Matplotlib – Visualizing the processing steps (optional)
Jupyter Notebook – For step-by-step development and testing
